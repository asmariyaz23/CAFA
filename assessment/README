CAFA Asessment Program

The CAFA Assessment program is designed to assess user's predictions against a standard benchmark set. This benchmark set
could be created either using the CAFA Benchmark generator or using any other software, being consistent with the format.

The CAFA Assessment program can be run in the following way:

python Assess -P <prediction filename> -B <benchmark filename>

This simple command will compare predictions in the prediction file with the benchmark and score the method accordingly.

There are a few optional parameters that be viewed by typing this command:

python Assess --help

There are a variety of metrics that can be used to assess protein function predictions. The one currently used by the
program is the protein-centric measure. So, this tries to measure how well a particular protein has been predicted. The
other metric that will be added in the future is called the term-centric measure, which checks how well a certain term in
the GO tree has been predicted. 

Output :

The output of the Assessment program is a tab delimited file with precision - recall values for every threshold at which
a prediction has been submitted. A precision-recall curve of the same is also provided to obtain graphic visualization of
the performance of the method.The curve will also help identify the best point, at which both the precision and recall
are reasonably good. The higher this average is, the better the performance of the prediction method.
